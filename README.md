"# P2_traffic_sign_classifier" 
This is a solution to the project of classifying traffic signs using a deep neural network!
The training and testing data was too large to fit in this repository. One is requested to add these files and modify the initial python code to get the train/test data. You can get the data from the below two links

train data - 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/datasets/german_traffic_sign_benchmark/train.p

test data -
https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/datasets/german_traffic_sign_benchmark/test.p

Make sure that the train/test data are images of size 32x32x3 before you feed the data into the classifier.
